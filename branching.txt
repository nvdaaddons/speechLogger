There are three main-line branches: master, beta, and dev.
Master is stable, and where all work ends up.
Beta is for things thought stable, but may need testing. Also for non-compatible future NVDA versions.
Dev is for public testing, usually rebased on either master or beta, depending on NVDA target.

To add a feature:
Checkout new branch named feature.
Update copyright date if necessary, in source files.
Update version in source files.
Work.
Then check out dev.
Update buildVars with new version.
Merge in "feature".
If testing works, checkout feature and clean up history.
Then merge feature into beta or master.
repeat for other main-line branches.
